 * Impurity calculation method of decision tree. It is used during training while trying to find best split. For example
 * one split results in 5 positive and 5 negative labels and another in 9 positive and 1 negative. Impurity calculator
 * should return high value in the first case and low value in the second. That means that during training we will
 * prefer second split as that will provide most information. Most popular methods are entropy and gini index.
 * 
 * Annotated as functional interface to allow lambda usage.
